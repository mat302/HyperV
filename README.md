# HyperV
This is HyperV, a 3D video game I developed with C#, Microsoft XNA, WPF and XAML.

To see a lot more of what this game features, feel free to play it!

Because I tought it would be cool, I decided to include screenshots showcasing the evolution of the development of this game over the months.

Here's how HyperV looked like after one week
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled.png?raw=true)
Yes, the project was supposed to be on UWP at the beginning, but it had to be changed to WPF due to technical reasons
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled1.png?raw=true)
After one month, the project looked like this.
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled2.png?raw=true)
As you can see, the front end of the menu was already pretty similar to the final version at this point. It only had front-end though.
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled4.png?raw=true)
I must also add that there was an Android version up to this point, which has stopped being developed afterwards due to other technical reasons
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled3.png?raw=true)
Now, let's see how it looked after two months
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled5.png?raw=true)
As you can see, it included a test level in which the first versions of the bison and the gear puzzle were tested. In the back we can still see the same maze from the version of a month before. Other components were added later such as height maps an water.
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled6.png?raw=true)
This version also included the hub with a first NPC which was still in a testing phase at that time as you can see.
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled7.png?raw=true)
The hub had one "level" wich was the testing level above. The game already had a pretty complete interface at that time with the possibility to save games anywhere in the game.
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled8.png?raw=true)
Recovering this version was more of a pain because it used a dll from a library I created at that time called BasicComponents. Also, it used static file paths I had to change because they were not relevent anymore on my computer. It was a pain but reseeing this version was worth it for the souvenirs and the nostalgia . . .
After three months, the project looked like this
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled9.png?raw=true)
The hub map was completely similar to the current except for the textures, NPCs and little details. All the portals were created but not all of them were ready. Level 1 was not a testing ground anymore but the beginning of what we have today.
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled10.png?raw=true)
The models and textures were not the same and not as pretty though. Especially for that sword XD. Can you recognize the mountain of World 1?
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled11.png?raw=true)
The swamp level had his first version and same for World 2. Do you recognize World 2's forest?
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled12.png?raw=true)
![Alt text](/Screenshots/Untitled13.png?raw=true)
After this version, the core of the project looked pretty much like today if we forget about the optimization and debugging. It had the system I created to create levels from text files with a particular syntax I invented and compiled in C# and many other technilaties I'll not detail too much because it would take a lot of time.

After four months, the project became was it is today.

If you want to test the game, you'll preferably need Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, Microsoft XNA installed and that's it. With that you should be in business to compile the game. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
Sincerly,
