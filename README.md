To see a lot more of what this game features, feel free to play it!

I must also add there's a partial version of the game on Android. It has not been completelly developed yet because of technical reasons.

If you want to test the game, you'll preferably need Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, Microsoft XNA installed and that's it. With that you should be in business to compile the game. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
Sincerly,
